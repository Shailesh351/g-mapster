#G-Mapster

A hack in which helps in cleaning areas in cities.(useful for municipalities).

*How to use : 
	*Take a picture in your mobile where you see garbage or litter in any area.
	*Go to https://g-mapster.herokuapp.com
	*Click upload and upload the pic
	*That's it.You are done.

The location and the image is stored in the database and the admin side(municipalities) can view it on map.
As the number of images from a particular area increases, the priority of cleaning that area also increases.
This is how it works.
